# DataScience-Roadmap
This repository is dedicated to my progress in DS & ML. It is created as a digest of my work examples, storage of samples and for the sake of my personal motivation. Certificates on finishing of courses you may find <a href="https://github.com/hipufka/DataScience-Roadmap/tree/main/Certificates">here</a>.
